# Neuron
A C++ design of Neurons for Neural Networks

# Description

This is some proof of concept code for creating different NN types in C++, the
idea is to create a toolset of layers used for Neural networks and using a 3D 
graphics library to create a state machine that allows the creation and 
observation of said networks during training.
